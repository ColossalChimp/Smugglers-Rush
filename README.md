**A modern tribute to the classic off‑road smuggling franchise**

Smuggler's Rush is a love letter to the legendary 2000 and 2001 titles *Smuggler's Run* and *Smuggler's Run: Hostile Territory*. It's the remaster—or rather, the reimagining—I’ve always wanted to see. All-be-it mine is in a LowPoly format, as I am still learning the ropes in Game Development.
