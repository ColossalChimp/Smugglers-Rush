Thank you for purchasing Toon City!

If you like it, pleaase review it :)


The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a 1x1 grid 
placement system.

Make sure you have the V2 Post Processing Stack imported in your project, if you are using the Standard Render Pipeline.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”

The textures used by the materials are very small in size: the diffuse 
texture is 128*128 and the ramp texture is just 128*4.

Some of the objects have moving parts, such as animated lights, animated doors, etc.
It's easy to edit their position and rotation, by selecting them from the objects’ hierarchy.
