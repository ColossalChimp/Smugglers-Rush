The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a 1x1 grid placement system.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base, except those that require a different placement.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”


Some of the objects have moving parts, such as animated lights, animated doors, etc.
It's easy to edit their position and rotation, by selecting them from the objects’ hierarchy.

The assets: Crane_1A & Crane_1B are rigged and in order to move their components, you must use the corresponding 
bones from the asset’s hierarchy.
